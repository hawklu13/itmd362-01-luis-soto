project name: portfolio website – luis soto

description:
this is my final project for my web development class. the goal was to take a design idea and turn it into a real website using html, css, and javascript. i decided to make a personal portfolio website that shows who i am, what i’m working on, and two of my past projects.

design inspiration:
i used a portfolio-style layout example as inspiration. here’s the image that inspired my design:
https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cmsfly.com%2F635bcad9b8a74e0091632998%2Fdalya-baron-V5xeZs.webp&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=f0f6a18f14111b0428d652e64d92ddc830f862a80d810f58c96113b6181d9ad5

i based my layout on clean sections, centered content, rounded corners, simple spacing, and a dark-style theme. i made the design more “me” by adding my own pictures, my colors, and my project descriptions.

--------------------------------------------------
project requirements (from the assignment):
1. html requirements
- must include at least three main sections
- must include at least three images
- must use semantic html

2. css requirements
- must use an external css file
- must use flexbox or grid for layout
- must match or follow the chosen design inspiration

3. javascript requirements
- must include at least 3 types of interactivity

4. submission requirements
- project folder must include:
  index.html
  style.css
  script.js
  readme.txt

--------------------------------------------------
how my website meets the requirements:

html:
- i used three main sections: hero, projects, and contact.
- i included more than three images (hero image, project images, and decorative images).
- sections and content use semantic html, including header, main, section, article, etc.

css:
- all styling is in my external style.css file.
- i used both flexbox and grid: flexbox for the hero and contact layout, and grid for the project cards.
- design matches the inspiration style and layout i aimed for (clean, centered, modern look).

javascript interactions:
1. theme toggle:
   - switches between dark mode and light mode.
2. modal popup:
   - clicking “more info” on a project opens a bigger version of the project image.
3. form validation:
   - the contact form checks if all fields are filled and gives feedback messages.

--------------------------------------------------
project sections:

hero section:
- a short intro about me and a main image.

projects section:
- project 1: “itmd 361 project”
  description: website assignment where i turned my resume into a webpage and made pages about my favorite things (sports and an interactive map).

- project 2: “ap computer science principles project”
  description: first project i ever coded at age 14. lets users pick an nba team from a dropdown and shows info from a data table.

contact section:
- a contact form centered between two images.
- includes name, email, message, and a simple form feedback system.

--------------------------------------------------
challenges i faced:
- getting the modal to show images at the right size.
- fixing spacing between buttons and text inside the project cards.
- making sure the theme toggle actually matched the correct color mode.
- cleaning up and organizing the code so it’s readable and looks like a real portfolio.
- making sure the layout looked good on different screen sizes.

--------------------------------------------------
final notes:
this project helped me practice real html, css, and javascript in one place. it feels like a good start for a personal portfolio and a foundation i can keep improving.
