        <h1>Hello, my name is Luis Soto!</h1>
        <p>
          I am a student with a growing interest in web development and cybersecurity.
          I enjoy learning how websites work, experimenting with different tools, and
          building projects that help me improve my skills. I'm always trying to get
          better with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and this website is one of the ways
          I practice what I'm learning.

          <p>
            This was an assignment for one of my classes last year. I had to turn my resume
            into a website and create two extra pages about things I like. One page was about
            my favorite sports team, and the last page was an interactive map with pinpoints
            of my three favorite places. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

          <h3>AP Computer Science Principles Project</h3>
          <p>
            This was my project for AP Computer Science Principles in high school. I was 14,
            and it was the first thing I ever coded. It was a simple app that pulled NBA team
            information from a data table. You could pick a team from a dropdown and see basic
            info about them. It only used JavaScript, but it was fun and made me excited to keep
            learning more about programming.
